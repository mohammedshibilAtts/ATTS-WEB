    introduction: `Have you thought about email list building? Do you want to build an email list, but aren't sure why?

Email list building is an essential component of any business. It is the most cost-effective and efficient way of connecting with your customers. Email marketing has been proven to be the most effective digital marketing channel for businesses.

It is estimated that 80 percent of professionals believe that email marketing is effective in acquiring and retaining customers. The more customers you have coming to you for their needs, the more likely they will be to stay with you when their needs arise again in the future.

The key to successful email list building is segmentation. Every customer has different needs and interests, so it's important to know what they want from you before you email them a campaign or offer. You can do this by using tools like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Hotjar to track their behaviour on your website, social media channels, and blog posts respectively. You can also do this by using surveys or asking them directly about their preferences through live chat on your website or social media channels.

Having a website and hoping people find it isn't enough. You need to go out and actively market your business. Emails are a great way to do this, with the added bonus of being able to track the performance of each email you send.

In order for your emails to be successful, you will need an email list or database with contact information for your customers or potential customers. Building that database takes time, but it doesn't have to take much of your time because there are many ways you can build it up passively.

Most people view email as one of the most effective marketing methods in existence (although some may say that it is becoming less popular because spam filters make it more difficult). It has a number of benefits:

Email lists are a crucial part of an email marketing campaign for most businesses, but itâ€™s important to remember that there are two kinds of lists; opt-in and opted-out. Opted-in lists are made up of people who have subscribed or signed up to receive the newsletter or emails from a company. Opted-out lists are compiled through various data mining techniques and usually include people who have been contacted in some other way by the company already, such as visiting their website, watching their video on YouTube, etc.`,

Email inboxes are private. In this way, you can discuss the issues your customers are facing and help them to resolve them.

It is through such conversations that you are able to build intimate relationships with your customers. Word-of-mouth can always be one of the most effective methods of growing your business when you have happy customers.`,

Your email list, however, belongs to you and you alone. A mailing list guarantees access to thousands of users' inboxes, at least until they stop using it.`,
